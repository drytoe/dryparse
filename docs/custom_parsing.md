# Custom parsing

```{toctree}
```

The easiest way to parse a command line into a
{class}`~dryparse.objects.Command` is using the {attr}`~dryparse.parser.parse`
function. But sometimes you may want to customize individual steps of the
process, or even the entire process.

While the {ref}`object model<Object model>` is complete and flexible enough for
you to write your custom parser, we provide utilities that allow you to "hook"
into various steps of the process and change them individually.

This section describes how you would do that.
